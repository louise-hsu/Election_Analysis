By performing these tasks, I learned the following:

1. Python syntax 
2. reading data files
3. sorting the data into lists and dictionaries
4. commiting my code 
5. writing results into new tect files
6. and more...

## Challenge Overview
Seth is asked by the elction commission if his team can confirm the voter turnout for each county that coted in this congression district

1. Make a copy of the PyPoll.py file, and rename it PyPoll_Challenge.py
2. Create list for the counties
3. Create dictionary where the county is the key and the votes cast for each county in the election are the values.
4. Create an empty string that will hold the county name that had the largest turnout.
5. Declare a variable that represents the number of votes that a county received
6. Indie the with open() func where you are outputting the file, do the following:
    - Create three if statements to print out the voter turnout results similar to the results shown above.
    - Add the results to the output file.
    - Print the results to the command line.
